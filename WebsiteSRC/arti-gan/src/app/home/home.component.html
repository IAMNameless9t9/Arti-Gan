<h1>Welcome to Project Arti-GaN!</h1> 
<h2>Vision for the Project:</h2>
  <p>
    Arti-GaN is an Artificial Intelligence-based Image Generator. Using Generative Adversarial Networks and small datasets of images, we are able to create an AI capable of generating similar, but unique images, and through human interaction train those same AIâ€™s to generate more aesthetically pleasing images.
  </p>

<h2>The Project:</h2>
  <p>
    For our product, we intend to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GaN) that can synthesize new aesthetic images (though research may lead us down a different path by which to accomplish what we want). We will train the GaN to achieve this by taking in a dataset of images and outputting a new, but unique image. Users will be able to go to the website and will be presented with a sample image generated by the GaN that we trained.
  </p> 

  
<h2>How it works:</h2>
  <h3>The Generator -</h3>
    <p>Generates pixels based on a random number and returns the image</p>
  <h3>The Discriminator -</h3>
    <p>Takes in dataset and image generated by the generator and returns a probability. (0 being fake and 1 being authentic) It does this by scraping the images by some number of pixels and comparing them to the trained discriminator</p>
  <p>If the image fails, the generator changes itself to produce pixels groups that failed the test to produce images that pass the discriminator test</p>
