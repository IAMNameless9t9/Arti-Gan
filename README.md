For our product, we intend to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can synthesize new aesthetic images (though research may lead us down a different path by which to accomplish what we want). We will train the GAN to achieve this by taking in a dataset of images and outputting a new, but unique image. To gather feedback for the GAN, we intend to create a web-based front end to crowdsource options on the GANâ€™s performance. Users will be able to go to the website, and will be presented with a sample image generated by one of several copies of the base GAN that we trained, and tell the server whether or not they find the image aesthetically pleasing, and then the algorithm will generate a  new image for them to judge; the goal being that the GAN will increase the number of positive reviews it receives.
